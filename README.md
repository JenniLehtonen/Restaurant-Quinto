## Restaurant Quinto
You can visit the application [here](https://jennilehtonen.github.io/Restaurant-Quinto/).
The purpose of this project is to develop my skills in web developement (coding and UI). I also wanted to develop a website with multiple pages. This website consists of 5 pages: home, menu, our story, contact and reservations. This is my first own website project to which I have added new features when I have learned new technologies in school.

Used technologies: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap**. I have used JavaScript in contact and reservation forms and in scroll back to top button in the menu page. The function that shows to the user in which page they are is built with jQuery. The navigation bar is built with a ready Bootstrap template that I found on the internet.
