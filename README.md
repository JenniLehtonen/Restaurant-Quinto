## Restaurant Quinto

The purpose of this project is to develop my skills in web development. This website consists of 5 pages: home, menu, our story, contact and reservations.

Used technologies: **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap**. I have used JavaScript in contact and reservation forms and in scroll back to top button in the menu page. The function that shows to the user in which page they are is built with jQuery. The navigation bar is built with a ready Bootstrap template that I found on the internet.
